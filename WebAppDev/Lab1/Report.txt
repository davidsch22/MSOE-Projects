# Introduction
In this lab, we go through some of the basics of HTML and CSS by creating a simple webpage
that displays our winter quarter schedule. How it displays on the normal page will be
different from the printing preview.

# Summary
From this lab, we learned how to properly structure our HTML code, as well as how to link
the CSS stylesheets to the HTML. We also learned how to change the stylesheet that's being
used based on the type of media the page is being viewed as.

# Suggestions
I thought that making the two different stylesheets for different purposes, one for the
printing preview and one for the normal site, was really interesting. It's not something
I've done when working with HTML and CSS in school before. In the future, I'd suggest
giving more specific instructions with how exactly to do certain things with CSS, since
there are many different ways it can be done.
