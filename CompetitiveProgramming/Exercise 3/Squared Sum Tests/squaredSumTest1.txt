	1 1
A discussion of
	What is it testing?
		It's testing for correctness, runtime, and memory usage with an
		edge case.
	Why does it make a good test case?
		It's the lowest possible input value. (Edge case)
Execution time for the solution on that test case
	Running Sum: 381000 ns
	Binary Search: 35100 ns
