A discussion of
	What is it testing?
		It's testing for correctness, runtime, and memory usage with the
		largest possible input value, since the largest input will take
		the longest time to calculate.
	Why does it make a good test case?
		It's the highest possible input value. (Edge case)
Execution time for the solution on that test case
	Running Sum: 3407929700 ns
	Binary Search: 63758675200 ns
